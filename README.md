# officiant-script



We’ve all gathered today to celebrate a turning point in both James Hong and Melissa Liu’s lives.  We’ve come to actively support their relationship and publicly witness their commitment to each other. Melissa and James have invited us to this special occasion because, collectively, we are a group of the most important people in their lives. Each of us has contributed in some way to the love they share for one another today.

Many of you travelled long distances or cancelled other obligations in order to attend this ceremony. Melissa and James wanted me to thank you all for making it here today and to recognize how important each and every one of you are in their lives. They would also like to recognize all of those who couldn’t be here today as they are missed but not forgotten on this day of celebration.

Marriage is a way to give permanence to James and Melissa’s relationship.  It means James continuing to support Melissa through many if not an infinite number of years of Phd program. It means Melissa accepting that at least part of their future home will be a 3D printing and/or makeshift car-manufacturing engineering lab. It also means taking turns walking Milo and keeping him from eating curbside garbage. It’s acknowledging that their lives have grown together, as they’ve developed new common interests and hobbies from fencing to marathon-running. And it’s wanting to continue their lives together, supporting each other through challenges and strengthening their love through those struggles.

Melissa and James will now like to share personal vows for each other.
 
Bride: Reads her vows.
Groom: Reads his vows.
May I please have the rings?

The ring has always been a symbol of the unbroken circle of love, with no beginning and no end. Love given freely has no giver and no receiver, for each is the giver and each is the receiver. May these rings always remind you of the freedom and power of this commitment you make here today.

Do you James take Melissa to be your wife.
To have and to hold,
in sickness and in health,
for richer or for poorer,
in joy and sorrow,
and I promise my love to you.
And with this ring,
I take you as my Wife,
for as long as we both shall live.

[I Do]

[Groom puts ring on Bride’s finger]

Melissa, please take James’ hand and repeat these words.
Do you Melissa take James to be your husband.
To have and to hold,
in sickness and in health,
for richer or for poorer,
in joy and sorrow,
and I promise my love to you.
And with this ring,
I take you as my husband,
for as long as we both shall live.

[I Do]

[Bride puts ring on Groom’s finger]

I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss.

It’s my great honor and privilege to present to you Mr. and Mrs. James and Melissa Hong.

# officiant-script
We’ve all gathered today to celebrate a turning point in the lives of James Hong and Melissa Liu.  We’ve come to actively support their relationship and publicly witness their commitment to each other. Melissa and James have invited us to this special occasion because, collectively, we are a group of the most important people in their lives. Each of us has contributed in some way to the love they share for one another.

Many of you have travelled long distances in order to attend this ceremony. Melissa and James want to thank you all for making it here today and for recognizing how important each and every one of you are in their lives. They would also like to recognize all of those who couldn’t be here today, as they are missed but not forgotten on this day of celebration.

Marriage is a way to give permanence to James and Melissa’s relationship.  It means James continuing to support Melissa through a countless number of years of medical training. It means Melissa accepting that at least part of their home will be an engineering lab held together with duct tape. It also means taking turns walking Milo and trying to keep him from eating curbside garbage. It’s acknowledging that their lives have grown together, as they’ve developed new common interests and hobbies from fencing to half marathon-running. And it’s wanting to continue their lives together, supporting each other through challenges and strengthening their love through those struggles.

Melissa and James would now like to share their vows.
 
Groom: Reads his vows.
Bride: Reads her vows.
May I please have the rings?

The ring has always been a symbol of the unbroken circle of love, with no beginning and no end. May these rings always remind you of the commitment you make here today.

Do you James take Melissa to be your wife.
To have and to hold,
in sickness and in health,
for richer or for poorer,
in joy and in sorrow,
for as long as you both shall live?

[I Do]

[Groom puts ring on Bride’s finger]

Do you Melissa take James to be your husband.
To have and to hold,
in sickness and in health,
for richer or for poorer,
in joy and in sorrow,
for as long as you both shall live?

[I Do]

[Bride puts ring on Groom’s finger]

I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss.

It’s my great honor and privilege to present to you Mr. and Mrs. James and Melissa Hong.
